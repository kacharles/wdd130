        Hello! My name is Charles Alfred Koenig, a 24 year-old Liberian living in Northern Cyprus, and a student currenly enrolled in BYU-I online. 
        I recently completed PathwayConnect and I am now enrolled in the online degree at BYU-I pursuing a degree in software development.
        I am also a graduate of NIIT BlueCrest Liberia with a professional certificate in software developement. As an aspiring software and web developer, I 
        am eager to learn and leverage my knowledge of web development technologies and programming languages to create dynamic and user-friendly websites. 
        With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and experience in font-end framework like Twitter Bootstrap, I am excited to take this WDD130 course, learn
        new technologies, collaboarte with my fellow students and contribute to innovative projects while continuously improving my skills. I am looking forward to a

            Northern Cyprus is a self-declared state located on the northern part of the
            island of Cyprus in the eastern mediterranean. It was established in 1983 following 
            a Turkish melitary intervention in response to a coup by Greek Cypriots seeking to 
            unify the island with Greece. Northern Cyprus is recognized only by Turkey, and is 
            considered by the international community to be occupied territory of the Republic
            of Cyprus. The economy of Northern Cyprus is heavily dependent on Turkey, with tourism
            and education being the primary sources of income.
