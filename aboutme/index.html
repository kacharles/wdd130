            <p>Hello! My name is Charles Alfred Koenig, a 24 year-old Liberian living in Northern Cyprus, and a student currenly enrolled in BYU-I online. 
            I recently completed PathwayConnect and I am now enrolled in the online degree at BYU-I pursuing a degree in software development.

                "Northern Cyprus is a self-declared state located on the northern part of the
                island of Cyprus in the eastern mediterranean. It was established in 1983 following 
                a Turkish melitary intervention in response to a coup by Greek Cypriots seeking to 
                unify the island with Greece. Northern Cyprus is recognized only by Turkey, and is 
                considered by the international community to be occupied territory of the Republic
                of Cyprus. The economy of Northern Cyprus is heavily dependent on Turkey, with tourism
                and education being the primary sources of income." -wiki
